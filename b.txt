Opening (Warm, Human, Grounded)

“First, I wanted to say thank you for taking the time to meet. I know this is a busy and emotional period.”

Pause. Let him respond.

🙏 Appreciation (This Is the Core)

“I really wanted to personally thank you for the trust you placed in me — especially when you rehired me after I moved to Canada. That meant a lot to me, both professionally and personally.”

Optional add-on (if it feels natural):

“Coming back into the organization at that stage in my life gave me a lot of confidence and stability.”

This lands as gratitude, not dependency.

🧭 Acknowledge His Impact (Without Overdoing It)

“You’ve been a constant presence and a steady influence in this group for a long time. Your leadership has shaped the way teams work together, and that will definitely be felt.”

This validates him without flattery.

💬 Personal Reflection (Short, Honest)

“I’ll be honest — the news of your departure did shake me a bit. Not in a negative way, but because of how much respect I have for you and what you represent here.”

This is vulnerability without fear language.

🔍 Seek Perspective (Very Important)

“From your perspective, as someone who knows this organization deeply, what advice would you give people like me as the team goes through this transition?”
