I wanted to acknowledge the recent news about [Leader’s Name] leaving. He’s been a big presence in the group for a long time, and I know this is a period of transition for everyone.

---------------
“From your perspective, how stable do you see the roadmap and funding for our work over the next 6–12 months?”

“Do you anticipate any impact to staffing or resourcing as leadership changes settle?”

=======
“Given the leadership change, I wanted to check in on expectations around contractor continuity. From what you see today, do you anticipate any changes or concerns around contract extensions?”

Feed back about self:

=================
“From your perspective, how am I doing? Is my work meeting expectations?”

“Is there anything you’d like me to strengthen to increase my impact?”
=======================
Closing
“I really enjoy the work and the team, and I want to continue contributing meaningfully. I appreciate any guidance you have as we move through this transition.”
