Here’s the exact, no-nonsense answer you can give and follow yourself. This is one of those things that sounds mysterious but is actually very straightforward.

What “create AzureWebJobsStorage” really means

You do NOT create something called “AzureWebJobsStorage” as a resource.

👉 You create a normal Azure Storage Account,
👉 then reference its connection string in the Function App setting named AzureWebJobsStorage.

That’s it.


---

Step-by-step: How DevOps (or you) create it

1️⃣ Create an Azure Storage Account

In Azure Portal:

1. Create resource


2. Search for Storage account


3. Click Create



Fill in:

Setting	Value

Subscription	Prod subscription
Resource Group	Same RG as Function App (recommended)
Storage account name	e.g. stagillinkremapfuncprod
Region	Same region as Function App
Performance	Standard
Redundancy	LRS (ZRS is also fine if policy requires)
Account kind	StorageV2 (general purpose v2)


You can leave the rest as default.

✅ This storage account is your future AzureWebJobsStorage.


---

2️⃣ Get the connection string

After creation:

1. Open the Storage Account


2. Go to Access keys


3. Copy Connection string (key1)



It will look like:

DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;
AccountName=stagillinkremapfuncprod;
AccountKey=xxxxxxxx;
EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net


---

3️⃣ Configure it in the Function App

Now wire it to the Function App.

Azure Portal → Function App → Configuration → Application settings

Add:

Name	Value

AzureWebJobsStorage	<connection string from storage account>


Also confirm this exists:

Name	Value

FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME	dotnet-isolated


Save → Restart Function App.


---

That’s literally it

There is:

❌ no blob container you manually create

❌ no queue you manually configure

❌ no table you manually define


Azure Functions creates and manages everything internally inside that storage account.


---

How to explain this to DevOps (one clean sentence)

> “AzureWebJobsStorage is just an app setting pointing to a standard GPv2 storage account. Azure Functions uses it internally for timers and locks.”




---

How to verify it’s working (important)

After deployment:

1. Open Function App → Logs


2. Trigger the function (or wait for timer)


3. You should NOT see errors like:

“Unable to acquire host lock”

“Storage account unavailable”

“AzureWebJobsStorage is missing”




If you do → storage or networking issue.


---

Common mistakes to avoid (tell DevOps this)

❌ Using UseDevelopmentStorage=true in prod
❌ Using a storage account in a different region
❌ Blocking the Function App with storage firewall rules
❌ Forgetting to restart after setting the value


---

TL;DR

Create Azure Storage Account (GPv2)

Copy connection string

Put it in Function App App Settings as AzureWebJobsStorage

Restart
