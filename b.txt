🧠 AI Invoice Ingestion – Meeting Cheat Sheet (1 Page)
🎯 Meeting Goal (keep this in mind)

Design a loosely coupled AI module for invoice ingestion:

Independent of AI vendor (Aiden Assist, Microsoft, etc.)

Independent of AgilLink

Versioned interface (v1, v2 side-by-side)

Simple, scalable data storage

Clear ownership of vendor matching

🧩 High-Level Architecture (Shared Understanding)

AI Module

Extracts data from invoice PDFs

Returns structured output (JSON)

AgilLink

Owns invoice UI, client/vendor records

Handles vendor selection & corrections

Storage

Extracted JSON stored in Azure Blob Storage

Keyed by DocumentKey (unique, stable identifier)

🗣️ Ready-to-Ask Questions (Pick 4–6 total)
1️⃣ Alignment (early)

“Just to confirm — the goal is a loosely coupled, versioned AI module, JSON stored in Azure Storage by DocumentKey, and vendor matching handled separately. Is that accurate?”

2️⃣ AI Module & Versioning

“For the versioned interface, will AgilLink explicitly call v1 vs v2, or do we plan to abstract that so we can switch defaults later?”

3️⃣ Extracted Data Storage

“Are the extracted JSON files intended to be immutable once written, or do we expect reprocessing and updates over time?”

Optional follow-up:

“If updates are possible, would we version the blobs or overwrite by DocumentKey?”

4️⃣ Vendor Matching Ownership

“Since vendor matching is tightly tied to invoice entry and client/vendor records, are we leaning toward AgilLink owning that mapping rather than the AI module?”

5️⃣ Your Value-Add: Day-One Vendor Suggestions

“Since the vendor mapping table will be empty on day one, could we consider a background backfill process that scans historical invoices, extracts vendor text, and associates it with the vendor users had already selected? That could bootstrap vendor suggestions from day one.”

(Stop talking after this — let them react.)

6️⃣ Ambiguity & Confidence

“If the same vendor text historically maps to multiple vendors, do we want to store frequency counts and suggest the most common one, or always require user confirmation?”

7️⃣ Audit & Safety (late meeting)

“Do we need to distinguish between system-generated mappings and user-confirmed mappings for audit or troubleshooting?”

🔚 Closing Question (Very Strong)

“So the main open decisions are where vendor matching lives and how we bootstrap it, while the AI interface and extracted data storage are mostly aligned — is that fair?”
