10 questions to ask (in this order)
1) Confirm what “bad” looks like

“When this issue happens, what is the user-visible symptom? What exactly breaks?”
(Example: client transfer fails? EFT not visible? workflow stuck? bank posting mismatch?)

2) Get one concrete example

“Can you give me one real example from production (EFTID/WorkflowKey/ClientKey + date)?”
(You need one “golden case” to test your SP change.)

3) Identify the truth source you use to decide it’s posted

“When you decide the EFT is actually posted/complete, what evidence do you check first?”
Follow-ups:

“Do you check BankStatus=5?”

“Do you check DepositKey or PaymentKey?”

“Do you check BITTransKey exists?”

4) Determine if it’s always “posted but workflow open”

“In every case you fixed, was there bank/Deposit/Payment evidence even though WorkflowStatus.Status was 0?”
If “sometimes no” → there’s another root cause.

5) Clarify timing (transfer vs later process)

“Right after client transfer, is the workflow already wrong, or does it become wrong later?”
(This tells you if your SP is the right place to fix it.)

6) Pin down why TransactionStatus is sometimes updated

“When you updated only Status=1, did that always resolve it? If not, what remained broken?”

“What specific symptom forced you to also update TransactionStatus?”
(This is the most important question.)

7) Understand what TransactionStatus actually means in practice

“Do you know what TransactionStatus represents functionally? Which job/screen uses it?”
If they don’t know, ask:

“Do you remember where you learned to update it? (old ticket, KB, teammate)”

8) Capture the exact “rules of thumb” they follow

“What’s your rule: when do you update only Status, and when do you update both?”
(Even a rough heuristic is gold.)

9) Confirm business rule so you can justify your code change

“Business-wise: once an EFT is posted/settled, should its workflow ever remain open?”
If they say “no” → you have the rationale to enforce completion in the proc.

Optional: a 20-second opener you can say

“Hey, I’m fixing this at the source in usp_Move_EFT_TargetSiteCode so we stop running production update scripts. I want to make sure my logic matches how you determine a posted EFT and why sometimes you update TransactionStatus too.”

What you should write down during the call (simple template)

Example keys: ClientKey=__, EFTID=__, WorkflowKey=__, Date=__

Evidence checked: BankStatus? DepositKey? PaymentKey? BITTransKey?

Fix applied: Status only OR Status + TransactionStatus

Why TransactionStatus needed: ___________

Timing: immediately after transfer OR later

If you want to be extra efficient

Ask them to send you (Teams/email) either:

One old ticket link, or

The exact query they run to identify affected EFTs

If you paste their answers back (even rough notes), I’ll help you translate it into:

the exact SP change,

a safe rule for TransactionStatus updates,

and a PR/Change Request explanation reviewers won’t fight.
