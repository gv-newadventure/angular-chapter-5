Perfect. Here’s a clean, one-page script you can literally print or keep open during the meeting.
No fluff. Clear ownership. Calm, confident, senior-dev tone.

📄 Function App – DevOps Deployment One-Pager

1. What this Function App does

Timer-triggered Azure Function

Polls SQL in controlled batches

Processes records and updates status in DB

No queues, no Service Bus, no Event Grid

All idempotency, retries, and locking are handled in SQL



---

2. Mandatory Azure resources

Azure Function App

Runtime: .NET isolated

Hosting: Consumption or Premium (either is fine)

Region: Same as SQL


Azure Storage Account (Required)

Type: General Purpose v2

Purpose: Azure Functions runtime only

Used for:

Timer trigger state

Host locks

Execution coordination


Not used by application code directly


> ❗ Without this storage account, the Function App will not run reliably.




---

3. Required App Settings (must be configured)

Setting Name	Notes

AzureWebJobsStorage	Storage account connection string
FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME	dotnet-isolated
Infrastructure__MainConnectionString	SQL connection
Infrastructure__CommandTimeoutSeconds	SQL timeout
Remap__BatchSize	Batch size per poll
Remap__Parallelism	Controlled parallel execution
RemapTimerSchedule	CRON expression
Remap__ActiveWindow__Start	e.g. 02:00
Remap__ActiveWindow__End	e.g. 06:00
Remap__ActiveWindow__TimeZone	e.g. Pacific Standard Time


📌 All values are environment-configurable — nothing hardcoded.


---

4. Execution behavior (important)

Function may run longer than the timer interval

SQL claims records atomically

A second trigger will not double-process

If execution overlaps, SQL prevents duplicate work

Stuck records are safely retried after timeout



---

5. Scaling expectations

Designed for low scale / controlled concurrency

Scaling out aggressively is not required

Database owns work coordination, not the runtime



---

6. Logging & monitoring

Logging via Application Insights

No file logs

No Event Viewer usage

Errors and retries visible via App Insights + SQL status



---

7. Security / networking

Function App requires outbound access to:

SQL Server

Storage Account


If firewalls / private endpoints exist, allow Function App



---

8. Deployment expectations

Standard Function App deployment

No deployment slots required initially

Post-deploy validation:

Timer triggers

SQL batch claims

Status transitions




---

9. Known failure points (so we catch them early)

Missing or incorrect AzureWebJobsStorage

SQL connectivity blocked

Incorrect time zone or CRON configuration



---

10. Summary (one-liner)

> “This is a timer-driven, SQL-coordinated batch processor. AzureWebJobsStorage is mandatory for runtime stability, and all behavior is controlled via app settings.”
