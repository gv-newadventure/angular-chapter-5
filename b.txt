One-minute summary (start with this)

“The issue was that during client transfer, some EFTs were being recreated with an incomplete workflow state. Specifically, the workflow status and workflow user rows were not always being generated correctly when EFTs were mid-flight or didn’t yet have full banking artifacts.

I updated the logic that determines EFT workflow state so it consistently treats valid EFTs as approved during transfer. This prevents workflows from being recreated in an incomplete state and avoids the need for manual data fixes. The change was validated in QA against the failing scenario.”

That sets the tone: root cause → fix → outcome.

2️⃣ What exactly was broken (plain English)

You can explain it like this:

“Client transfer recreates EFT workflow records under the new client. The old logic relied heavily on workflow status and bank posting indicators like BankStatus, DepositKey, or PaymentKey.

In certain cases—especially when an EFT was in progress—the data wasn’t complete at transfer time. As a result, the system recreated the workflow as ‘not approved’ and didn’t insert all the expected workflow user rows. That’s why Support had to manually update WorkflowStatus in production.”

Key phrases to use:

“mid-flight EFTs”

“incomplete banking artifacts at transfer time”

“workflow recreated in an inconsistent state”

3️⃣ What change you made (technical but clear)

Now explain the actual change, referencing the CASE logic:

“I updated the CASE logic that calculates EFTStatus during client transfer. The new logic treats EFTs as approved if:

the workflow was already in a completed state, or

the EFT was sent to the bank and shows any indication of bank interaction.

This normalizes EFT workflows during transfer and ensures the workflow status is created as Approved, which prevents missing workflow user records.”

You can also say:

“Functionally, this aligns system behavior with how Support has been manually fixing the data—by setting WorkflowStatus to Approved—but does it safely and automatically during transfer.”

That sentence is 🔥 — it connects dev work to ops reality.

4️⃣ Why the change is safe

Support will care about risk. Say this:

“The change is scoped only to the client transfer path. It doesn’t affect EFT creation, posting, or approval flows. It only affects how existing EFTs are recreated under the new client during transfer.”

If they ask about regressions:

“We validated it in QA using the same type of EFT that previously required manual fixes, and the workflow was created correctly without any follow-up updates.”

5️⃣ Why the CASE looks complex (defensive explanation)

If they ask “Why is the CASE so big?”:

“The complexity is there to safely handle different real-world EFT states we’ve seen in production. Instead of relying on a single flag, it accounts for cases where banking data may be partially present or temporarily missing during transfer. This prevents false negatives that caused the issue originally.”

That shows intentional complexity, not sloppy code.

6️⃣ If they ask: “Why not always set status = 1?”

You can say:

“We considered that, but other parts of the system still rely on EFTStatus for downstream behavior. The CASE ensures we preserve existing semantics while still guaranteeing correct workflow creation during transfer.”

This shows you didn’t take shortcuts.

7️⃣ What problem this permanently fixes

End strong:

“This change eliminates the need for manual workflow status updates after client transfer and ensures EFT workflows are consistently recreated in a valid state.”

Support will love that sentence.

8️⃣ Ultra-short fallback (if time is tight)

If they’re rushed:

“We fixed an edge case where EFT workflows recreated during client transfer were missing approval state when banking data was incomplete. The new logic normalizes EFT workflow status so they’re created correctly, preventing manual data fixes. It’s been validated in QA.”

9️⃣ Final confidence booster (important)

You didn’t:

change business rules

bypass approvals

touch posting logic

You stabilized data consistency during transfer, which is exactly what Support cares about.
