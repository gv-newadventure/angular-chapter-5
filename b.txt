This email changes the situation quite a bit.

Let me break down what it really means.


---

What This Email Is Actually Saying

Key lines:

> “Borealis team will be building the API/capability to pull out the relevant fields from invoice documents…”



👉 They are building the extraction capability.

> “Our plan is to get both of you RBC VDI so you can work directly on the code with that team.”



👉 You will be working inside their Python codebase, not just consuming an API.

> “We will be directly working on code using Python to help build out this capability.”



👉 You are co-developing the AI extraction service.


---

This Is NOT Just Consumption

Earlier we thought:

ASP.NET → XYZ AI Service → JSON

Now it looks like:

Python Extraction API (co-developed by you + Borealis team)
⬇
Your ASP.NET Web API consumes it

So you’re not just supporting a finished service.
You are helping build or enhance it.

That means your Python scope increases — but still in a focused way.


---

Your Role Is Likely This

You will help:

Build or enhance a Python API for invoice extraction

Integrate document processing logic

Possibly improve field extraction

Make it production-ready

Coordinate between AI team and Microsoft stack team


You are becoming the bridge engineer.

That is actually a strong career move.


---

What Python You ACTUALLY Need Now

Now that you're working directly in their codebase, your learning priorities change slightly.

You need:

1️⃣ Python Fundamentals (But Only Practical Ones)

Functions

Classes

Dictionaries

Exception handling

File handling

JSON

Virtual environments

requirements.txt


Not theory-heavy stuff.


---

2️⃣ FastAPI or Flask (Very Important)

Most AI services use one of these.

You should understand:

@app.post("/extract")
async def extract_invoice(file: UploadFile):

Routing

Request handling

File uploads

JSON responses

Status codes


This is likely 40% of your job.


---

3️⃣ How ML Models Are Loaded and Used

You don’t need to train models.

But you must understand:

model = load_model("model.onnx")
result = model.predict(data)

And understand:

What is inference?

What is preprocessing?

What is postprocessing?



---

4️⃣ Document Processing (Very Likely)

Invoice ingestion usually involves:

PDF parsing

OCR

Field mapping

Confidence scores


Libraries you might see:

pdfplumber

pytesseract

opencv

onnxruntime


You don’t need mastery — just recognition and debugging capability.


---

What You Do NOT Need

❌ Deep ML math
❌ Training pipelines
❌ Neural network architecture
❌ Pandas-heavy analytics
❌ Jupyter research workflows

You are building a service, not a research lab.


---

Let Me Reframe Your Anxiety

Right now your brain is saying:

> “I don’t know Python. How can I work in a Python AI codebase?”



But here’s the reality:

You are already a developer.

Python syntax is the smallest part of this.

Architecture, integration thinking, debugging — those are transferable skills.


---

Here’s What I Recommend Immediately

Before learning randomly, do this:

Ask Borealis team these questions in your first meeting:

1. What framework is the API built on? (FastAPI? Flask?)


2. Is the model already trained?


3. What format is the model saved in?


4. Are we improving extraction or just wiring it?


5. Where is this deployed? (VM? Container? Kubernetes?)


6. What does “done” mean for our team?



Write these down.

This will shape your learning.


---

Now Let’s Talk Strategy (Very Practical)

Instead of watching beginner Python videos…

Do this:

Week 1

Learn Python by reading THEIR code.

Open files

Trace request flow

Follow how file is processed

Print debug logs


That’s 10x better than generic tutorials.


---

Week 2

Build a small FastAPI demo yourself locally.

Upload PDF → return dummy JSON.

That makes concepts click.


---

Week 3

Understand how model inference is triggered.


---

Important Career Insight

You are being placed in a cross-team AI integration initiative in a bank.

That is exposure.

If you handle this well, you become:

The AI go-to person

The integration architect

The bridge between Microsoft stack and AI stack


That is bigger than “learning Python.”


---

I Want To Ask You Something Strategic

Be honest.

Is your fear mostly about:

A) Not knowing Python syntax
B) Not understanding AI
C) Fear of being exposed as inexperienced
D) Not knowing what your exact responsibility is

Because the solution depends on which one it is.

Answer that, and I’ll guide you properly.
