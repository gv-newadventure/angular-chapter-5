Here’s a **quick retrospective cheat sheet** you can use immediately:

---

## ✅ What Went Well (Wins / Positives)

Pick things that created value, reduced friction, or improved outcomes:

* Delivered key milestones / sprint goals
* Good collaboration or communication
* Blockers resolved quickly
* Clear priorities or requirements
* Quality improvements / fewer bugs
* Stakeholder or customer satisfaction
* Efficient planning / estimation
* Helpful tools or automation

**Prompt to think fast:**
👉 *“What helped us move faster or smoother?”*

---

## ❌ What Went Wrong (Pain Points / Issues)

Focus on problems, not people:

* Missed deadlines / spillover work
* Unclear requirements or scope creep
* Communication gaps / silos
* Too many interruptions / context switching
* Bottlenecks or dependencies
* Technical debt slowing progress
* Over- or under-estimation
* Late feedback / rework

**Prompt:**
👉 *“What slowed us down or caused frustration?”*

## 🔧 How Can We Improve (Actionable Fixes)

Turn problems into small experiments:

* Clarify acceptance criteria earlier
* Break work into smaller tasks
* Limit work in progress (WIP)
* Improve handoffs / ownership
* Add earlier reviews or check-ins
* Reduce meeting overhead
* Automate repetitive tasks
* Document recurring decisions

**Rule of thumb:**
✔ Make improvements **specific & testable** (“Try X next sprint”).

## 💡 Ideas / Experiments to Suggest

Useful when discussion stalls:

* “Start / Stop / Continue” exercise
* Shorter planning cycles
* Dedicated focus time / no-meeting blocks
* Rotate responsibilities (reviewer, owner, etc.)
* Define clearer “definition of done”
* Retrospective themes (quality, speed, teamwork)
* Small automation / tooling improvements
* Better risk visibility (early warning signals)

---

## ⚡ Quick Facilitation Tricks (If Needed)

If conversation feels awkward or quiet:

* Ask: *“What frustrated you most this cycle?”*
* Ask: *“What should we definitely keep doing?”*
* Let people write silently for 2 mins
* Group similar topics instead of debating immediately
* End with **1–3 concrete actions**

If you tell me your context (team type, sprint/release, common issues), I can tailor this even tighter.
