// Required for WalkMe PROD initialization.
// WalkMe Server Storage mode aborts silently if GlobalUniqueUserID is missing.
// Removing this cookie will disable WalkMe UI/menu with no obvious errors.


PR Description

During investigation of the WalkMe production issue, we identified that WalkMe was not initializing at all, despite the CDN script loading successfully.

Root cause:

WalkMe PROD is configured to use Server Storage mode, which requires a stable user identifier (GlobalUniqueUserID). If this identifier is missing, WalkMe intentionally aborts initialization (no errors thrown, WalkMeAPI remains undefined).

Findings:

Recent cookie/authentication changes resulted in the GlobalUniqueUserID cookie no longer being issued during login. As a result, WalkMe self-disabled in PROD.

Resolution:

This change restores creation of the GlobalUniqueUserID cookie so WalkMe can complete initialization.
