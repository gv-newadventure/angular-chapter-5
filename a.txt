Justification
The value read from sessionStorage is used exclusively to construct a jQuery selector in order to locate existing DOM elements.
The data is never written into the DOM, never rendered as HTML, and never executed as JavaScript.
jQuery selector construction does not constitute a DOM-XSS sink.
Therefore this data flow is not exploitable and represents a false positive.
