The reported issue occurs in legacy third-party JavaScript (DeployJava.js) where document.location is assigned directly to location.href as part of a page reload / redirect flow.
No user-controlled input is embedded into HTML or JavaScript execution contexts.
There is no string concatenation, DOM injection, or script execution.
This pattern does not result in DOM-based XSS and is not exploitable.
